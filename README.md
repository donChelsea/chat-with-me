A mini chat messaging app using groupie for better recyclerview management

Groupie is a simple, flexible library for complex RecyclerView layouts.
Groupie lets you treat your content as logical groups and handles change notifications for you.

I tested Groupie by creating a mini chat app. The module includes a model for the messages, classes for send and recieve communication, 
and a simple user interface.
